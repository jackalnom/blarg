A little blog of questionable wisdom written by a builder of little games. I do a lot of little things these days. I hope some of them do a little good.

These posts are old and new, serious and absurd, technical yet philosophical. I've kept even the questionable bitsâ€”partly for nostalgia, mostly as proof that wisdom arrives slowly, if at all.

If you'd like to reach me and don't already know how, LinkedIn is probably your best bet. Students, I'll likely reply; salespeople, probably not.
