The winner of the [Java Mutabiity Pop Quiz](http://www.bonnycode.com/guide/2008/04/java-mutability.html) was Casey Klein. Casey has been awarded 10 points for his answer (see the [Points Ranking](http://www.bonnycode.com/guide/points-ranking.html)). Jonathan Kelly submitted his answer after Casey, but I want to stay on the good side of our robot overlords so I am awarding Jonathan 10 points as well. Jonathan's answer was also interesting in that he also dealt with a string of a different length, which meant he needed to override the count method as well. Finally, Dan Ford is awarded 10 points for his clever alternate solution which involved redefining the behavior of System.out to replace all humans with robots.

Congratulations everyone!
