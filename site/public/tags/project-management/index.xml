      <title>Cost benefit analysis for bear lovers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feature estimates are often blindly used for cost benefit analysis. This was no more apparent than when I once worked with a product manager named Bethany. She was responsible for what, in hindsight, was always a doomed social network for lovers of the North American Brown Bear. Bethany would routinely ask her developers to provide implementation costs for a long list of features. The developers would grumble and complain they need more detailed requirements before they can put together detailed estimates (because they had been burned in the past on being held to commitments based on changing scope). Bethany retorts that she just needs “T-shirt sizes”, which is code for wild ass guesses, so she can do cost benefit analysis. Logically, this makes sense. Like any savvy businesswoman, the product manager wants to get a return on her investment. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy a piano without first knowing the price, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer would always eventually relent and give her the feature estimates she asked for. The feature to let people upload pictures of their favorite bear for example would take 2 weeks to build. The feature to translate English into Bearease was estimated to take between 1 month and 2 years. The bear picture upload feature was a clear customer win and a frequent ask from the sites three customers, but the English to Bearease language translation was a real opportunity to differentiate their site from the other bear lover social networks. If the bearease translation feature cost only 1 month it made more sense to prioritize that feature, but not if it took 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethany went back to the developers and asked why there was such a wide estimate in the translation feature and if there was a way to bring it down to the 1 month side. The developers came back with a bunch of mumbo jumbo about corpuses and having to maintain the translator by hand. They could develop a version of the feature in 1 month, but they wanted to do something fancier. Bethany heard that it could be done in 1 month if they really wanted to and said “go forth and develop my Bearease translator.” (she literally said that, it was weird then and it is weird now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, as expected, the developers had cranked out a Bearease translator just like they said they would. Bethany and the developers had a big launch party, people drank a bit too much and they talked about all the money they were going to make when the site went IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horribly hungover (likely due to the preponderance of blended whisky drinks), Bethany then tasked the developers to start working on the bear picture upload feature she had put off earlier. The developers went to work and two weeks later Bethany came back to check in on their launch. The developers said they were still working on it, and it would take them another two weeks. Bethany was furious. The feature was only supposed to take 2 weeks, she demanded to know why they couldn&amp;rsquo;t make their commitment. The developers started venting about how they were spending half their time maintaining the Bearease translator, constantly adding new words to the dictionary as users tried to translate words that they didn&amp;rsquo;t already have translations for. Bethany was angry at the developers for not being able to develop new features quickly enough and the developers were similarly angry they were spending so much of their time maintaining dictionaries rather than coding new features. They spent so much time being angry with each other that they stopped developing features all together. Facebook swooped in and stole their Bear loving user-base (with the ability to upload &lt;a href=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Bearclaw2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Bear manicure&#34;&gt;bear pictures&lt;/a&gt; even!), and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethany and the developers took away opposite lessons from the whole experience. Bethany said working with developers is lame because they are lazy and don&amp;rsquo;t understand business. She started her own hedge fund and now has a net worth measured in billions of dollars. The lesson the developers pulled from the experience was to never again do a feature quick and dirty, and the next time a product manager asks them to build a Bearease translator, they will say it takes 2 years, end of story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bethany can now afford to send several teams of highly trained ninja assassins my way for saying this, I put forth the contention that both Bethany and the developers pulled away the wrong lesson. Bethany&amp;rsquo;s real mistake was equating implementation cost with the true cost of a feature for cost benefit analysis. Software features, like most business investments, have operating costs associated with them. Those operating costs can vary wildly and there is frequently a trade off between initial investment cost and operating cost. If Bethany had taken into account the full cost of the features, she may have decided that uploading bear pictures was actually the wiser investment (something Facebook was smart enough to pick up on). Or at least she would have come in with the right expectation on what she was getting with her initial Bearease translator, and budgeted for followup work to make the feature more operationally maintainable if it was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers on the other hand learned too simplistic a lesson on technical debt. Technical debt, like any form of debt, is not evil. Without the ability to go into debt (i.e., taking out a loan), most new businesses couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get off the ground in the first place. If the demand for a Bearease translator was uncertain or if the immediate rush to market of being the first to have a Bearease translator justified it, the one month implementation with high technical debt could absolutely be the correct decision. For example, if they launched the Bearease translator and it completely tanked, they at least would have only lost out on 1 month of work rather than 2 years worth of work. Requirements and customer adoption are so subtly variable and changing in software development that this is often in fact the best approach to take. As long as ongoing operational cost is measured and time is continuously budgeted to reduce it, everyone can benefit from such a rapid iteration methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m back and I hate your estimates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For 2,000 years, ever since the Ancient Greeks got it into their heads that disease was caused by excess fluids, most disease in the western world was treated through bloodletting. Your back hurts? Let&amp;rsquo;s drain a quart of blood and see how you feel! Need to amputate your foot? Better drain some blood first. Was the practice scientifically baseless and actually harmful? Hell yes! There are today some cases where bloodletting is validly practiced, but it is no longer the panacea it once was. Effort estimation is software development&amp;rsquo;s version of bloodletting. Developers use effort estimates to drive accountability, to conduct cost-benefit analysis, to pack sprints, create launch timelines and, I believe in some circles, to summon the nine dark lords of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we think effort estimates are the solution to all of these problems? Everything about effort estimates in software really is silly. Look at the homegrown rules we&amp;rsquo;ve come up with for estimates. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard more than one grizzled veteran tell me their preferred method is to take their initial estimate, double the number and up the unit of time (e.g., hour becomes day, day becomes week, etc.). This is always said in a semi-joking &amp;ldquo;but, no really, it works&amp;rdquo; tone.  In the 90s highly complicated methods of estimation became popular that involved lots of acronyms and I&amp;rsquo;m sure consultants. Now that agile has taken over the software industry we estimate using planning poker and Fibonacci numbers. The latest estimation technique is to sacrifice a goat and spread its entrails over a large area. Maybe that will finally be the trick that works, but I doubt it because as an industry, despite all these new techniques, we are still no better at estimating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve invested quite a bit of time at getting better at estimation. And I got a little better. But one day, while knee deep in goat entrails, I stepped back and looked at the whole mess and asked why am I doing this? To what end do we estimate and then re-estimate, pack a schedule just to pack it differently in a month. And at the end of this introspection I determined my life of software estimation had all been a fraud. I&amp;rsquo;d been wasting my time. I moved to Nepal and joined a small temple. And now the secret of why I haven&amp;rsquo;t been working on my blog is out. But after years of meditation I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to come back to the material world and spread my gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, to demonstrate that effort estimates are not only useless but also harmful, I shall attack each motivation on its own. I will start next week with my least favorite reason of all&amp;hellip; accountability!&lt;/p&gt;
