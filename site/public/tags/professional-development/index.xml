      <title>Where feedback goes to die</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a cabinet above my espresso maker where unused gifts go to sit. For each gift I said thank you, and it felt disrespectful to later throw them away, so they sit there for years. Acknowledged yet untouched; quietly accumulating[^1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabinet is what we used to jokingly call write-only storage. A physical manifestation of gratitude and obligation, but really just a way of postponing honesty. There are ideas, observations, and judgments we receive in much the same way: politely accepted, carefully stored, and just as carefully kept from interfering with how we live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback often ends up there. Thank the person offering it, assume good intent,  reassure ourselves that we&amp;rsquo;ve heard it. And then place it somewhere out of sight, where it can&amp;rsquo;t trouble the assumptions we were already acting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback matters because it is one of the few ways we ever learn that we are wrong. Most of us can go on for years acting on assumptions that no longer fit the world. Especially when those assumptions make us feel competent, justified, or familiar with ourselves. Without something that pushes back, error doesn&amp;rsquo;t correct itself. It simply settles in and becomes the often invisible background of our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowing-when-were-wrong&#34;&gt;Knowing when we&amp;rsquo;re wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas are structured so that nothing can ever count against them. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just bad at math&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;people are always out to get me.&amp;rdquo; Self-fulfilling prophecies that stop functioning as explanations and instead are just comforting stories we tell ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that one way to guard against this is to be clear, before acting, about what I expect to happen if I&amp;rsquo;m right. Without clearly set in advance, it is too easy to reinterpret any outcome as a success after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I design a course, for example, I expect students to struggle at certain points and also have an idea of when that should resolve for most students. I often introduce implementation ambiguity early on because I believe it serves a pedagogical purpose. If students express some discomfort in how they should solve a problem in the first week, that feedback doesn&amp;rsquo;t challenge my course design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that only works if there’s a point where continued struggle would force me to rethink the design. I have to be specific about what confusion I expect, and what outcomes should justify it by the end. Otherwise, I’m just building up an excuse for unclear instruction as “intentional ambiguity,” and the line between pedagogy and sloppiness disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern shows up in how we talk about ourselves. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just someone who speaks my mind, it&amp;rsquo;s not my fault if people can&amp;rsquo;t handle it&amp;rdquo; resembles a description, but it serves as a shield. The question worth asking isn&amp;rsquo;t whether it feels true, but whether there&amp;rsquo;s any feedback that would make us reconsider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback-isnt-a-score&#34;&gt;Feedback isn&amp;rsquo;t a score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people fail to accept compliments as often as they fail to accept criticism. We assume people are &amp;ldquo;just being nice.&amp;rdquo; Sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s fine — if people tell you you&amp;rsquo;re beautiful all day it&amp;rsquo;s probably good not to let it go to your head. On the other hand, if your students tell you that you look like Minecraft Steve, well, welcome to my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.bonnycode.com/minecraft-steve.png&#34; alt=&#34;I don&amp;rsquo;t see the resemblance to Minecraft Steve.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when people consistently praise our skills and we wave it off, we end up underestimating what we&amp;rsquo;re ready for. We don&amp;rsquo;t take on challenges we could handle because we discount positive signal as easily as negative. Feedback isn&amp;rsquo;t only useful for correction. It&amp;rsquo;s often the push we need to take on something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is how we frame it. If feedback is primarily evaluation (good or bad, constructive or unhelpful) then our job is to judge whether it&amp;rsquo;s accurate. Judging is a short step from dismissing. Not &amp;ldquo;is it true?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;is it fair?&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;what does it mean that someone walked away holding this belief?&amp;rdquo; Does that change anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a director at Amazon, long, long ago, someone on my team once told me I was scary. After they got to know me, they realized I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as scary&amp;hellip; but they were still a little scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was that this seemed ridiculous. I&amp;rsquo;m not scary; I&amp;rsquo;m kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked what made them feel that way. They said in meetings, when people would say things, I would tear apart their arguments, ask how they knew something to be true. They worried that if they spoke, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to back up what they said. I did it in a &amp;ldquo;nice&amp;rdquo; way (calm, smiling), but that almost made it worse. Like I was an analytical machine ready to point out their every flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounded like good leadership. I was an Amazonian; I was &lt;em&gt;insisting on high standards&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;diving deep&lt;/em&gt;, teaching my team to &lt;em&gt;be right, a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Those instincts got me to where I was. But by then I was a director with a large team, and the way you act carries more weight when you have power over people&amp;rsquo;s careers. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t encouraging rigor. I was shutting down conversation. At least when I was in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-worth-listening-to&#34;&gt;Who is worth listening to?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I give feedback to students or employees, they usually want more. More than I often feel I can give. They&amp;rsquo;re gracious and frequently grateful. They ask follow-up questions. The dynamic is easy. I have credibility; I&amp;rsquo;m expected to evaluate; and what I say might affect their grade or their career. Everything lines up. Most people can tell themselves they are open to feedback. Because in some situations, when delivered by some people, they are eager to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverse the direction and see how quickly this falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upward feedback, and I&amp;rsquo;m using that term broadly, is easy to dismiss. &amp;ldquo;Who are you to tell me how to do my job?&amp;rdquo; Subordinate to manager, patient to doctor, student to teacher, user to product manager. And, often, the skepticism is warranted; people without expertise tend to give bad advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Arthur Writes a Story,&amp;rdquo; Arthur asks for feedback on a simple story about a boy finding his puppy. Each person suggests adding their favorite element from their own stories. They are not so much engaging with Arthur&amp;rsquo;s story as they are invested in their own. By the end, Arthur&amp;rsquo;s story has metamorphasized into a science fiction rock opera comedy about space-elephants. &amp;ldquo;Listen to feedback&amp;rdquo; cannot mean &amp;ldquo;do whatever people tell you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.bonnycode.com/arthur-elephant.png&#34; alt=&#34;Arthur&amp;rsquo;s story goes off the rails.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to treat this insight as a license to dismiss categories of feedback entirely. The signal is rarely the literal suggestion. Arthur&amp;rsquo;s friends gave bad advice, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they couldn&amp;rsquo;t still provide useful feedback. The real skill is taking the time to understand why someone reacted the way they did, not just what they proposed as a solution. And then innovate based on what that reaction tells you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we reject feedback because it&amp;rsquo;s framed poorly or comes from someone without expertise, we lose the ability to understand how the people affected by our work are actually receiving it. A patient can&amp;rsquo;t tell a doctor how to practice medicine. But a patient knows when they feel unheard, confused, or scared. That&amp;rsquo;s a valuable perspective only they can give. Ignoring it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you more expert. It just makes you blind to how it feels to be on the receiving end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genuine-feedback-is-earned&#34;&gt;Genuine feedback is earned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who don&amp;rsquo;t like us sometimes say things to hurt us. But, especially in professional contexts, they are often stating something true. The truth is often a better weapon than pure falsehood. I saw this pattern repeatedly as a manager and now as a teacher. Two people would not get along. They&amp;rsquo;d both point out the other person&amp;rsquo;s flaws. The criticism was often wrapped in assumed bad intentions, but underneath it calls out something observably true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jack has no respect for other people. He is always late to meetings and when he does arrive derails the conversation to talk about things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter.&amp;rdquo; Is this feedback framed well? No. Does it give us some signal we can learn from, especially when combined with other details and perspectives? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every blunt response like above, you&amp;rsquo;d get its more oblique cousin. &amp;ldquo;I love Jack, he is so helpful. It can be disruptive sometimes though how he arrives late to our morning meeting. I know he takes the bus here, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t really his fault, but maybe we can move the meeting?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you deliver the feedback, &amp;ldquo;it is important that you arrive on time for our morning meeting.&amp;rdquo; The response is too often either &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t help it&amp;rdquo; or, far worse, &amp;ldquo;who said that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge is understandable. Negative anonymous feedback makes me want to play detective about who said it. If I can discredit the source’s motives or expertise, I don’t have to engage with the substance. But that habit leads to a dark, unproductive relationship with feedback. It’s healthier to start by treating it in good faith unless you have evidence otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dangerous part of this reaction is that even if you are right, you are signaling how you handle feedback. If you react with anger, or defensively, or sullenly, it causes those who value their relationship with you to hesitate next time. They learn to circle around. The unvarnished truth becomes something only your detractors will offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you respond differently, with genuine curiosity and visible change, then giving you feedback becomes a relationship-strengthening act. People who care about you start to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest feedback from someone who cares about you is often not a gift; it is something you&amp;rsquo;ve earned through your reactions to feedback in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work Hard, Have Fun, Go Home</title>
      <link>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/work-hard-have-fun-go-home/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/work-hard-have-fun-go-home/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hus·tle cul·ture&lt;/strong&gt;  ˈhə-səl ˈkəl-chər&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;noun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the performance of results when actual results are missing; specif.: a workplace ethos where the appearance of extreme effort is rewarded more than the achievement of tangible outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a management technique characterized by demanding longer work hours to compensate for a lack of strategic direction or a lack of management domain knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;archaic&lt;/em&gt;: the belief that professional success is directly and exclusively proportional to the time spent engaged in work-related activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt;: performative work, burnout culture, toxic productivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could lecture you on the dangers of burnout in tech, the importance of having a life outside your job, and the ethics of exploitation. For many ambitious, high-achieving young engineers and students, those warnings simply don’t matter. The thinking is: I’m at a point in life when I can work hard and put in long hours, so why not? I’ll reap the benefits later. I’ll go where hard work is most rewarded and live for the hustle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the same early in my working life. I tried to log as many hours as I could. My first jobs were paid hourly, so more hours meant more pay. I loved it when overtime was approved; it meant my bills were paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved into a salaried tech role, I kept working long hours even without the direct financial incentive. Part of it was insecurity: I worried I wasn’t as smart as people thought, so I worked extra to meet expectations. I hid how much I was working so people would think I was effortlessly talented. I went home when everyone else did, then devoured books, built simulations, and pursued deep understanding. Older mentors talked about paying your dues and building a strong work ethic for life. And the truth is, I often just loved the work. Solving difficult problems was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-power-through&#34;&gt;Just power through&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a tech lead in an organization run by a GM who lived and breathed rise and grind. His credentials were impeccable (think, Harvard MBA, McKinsey, straight to GM). And he was furious when things didn’t go his way. I mostly avoided his wrath because my team hit our goals. But the teams that missed a deadline? Mandatory weekends in the office, late nights, daily standups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the mistake of dialing into a large project meeting right before a long-planned family trip. One of my sister teams announced that a project due the next week was suddenly red and likely to slip by weeks. My GM exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became excited for my time to speak. My projects were going well, I thought their disaster would make me look better in comparison. And I was on that pre-vacation high, thinking about margaritas and the time I needed with family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I said in a tone that was unmistakably smug:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All our projects are on track and running as expected. As a reminder, I’ll be out next week in Cabo and won’t make next week’s meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence. I’d miscalculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;NO!&lt;/strong&gt; NO VACATIONS! This is a code red! You are going to help the project get on track! We are all one team here!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I protested that I knew nothing about the project. I even tried to cite &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peopleware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All the wrong things to say. I was ordered to cancel my time off, join the team over the weekend, and personally guarantee the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I canceled my trip; the rest of my family went, just without me. I tried to help the project but had no context. I was also tired; my body and mind had already prepared for a break and now it was yanked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was eventually abandoned before it ever launched. Several months later the GM stopped showing up to any meetings. A week-and-a-half later we got an email from our VP: our GM had taken a new role and they were looking for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-little-right-beats-a-lot-of-wrong&#34;&gt;A little right beats a lot of wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a turning point for me. Something broke in me: I stopped seeing the world as a list of tasks that just needed dev hours applied to them. Rather than work that weekend (my typical routine), I went to a coffee shop and just relaxed. My mind naturally went to reflection and I pulled out my notebook. I started planning. I could either be a victim of the unfairness in the world or I could strategize. I chose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That became my go-to strategy for the rest of my career, and it served me far better than my “just power through it” approach ever did. The beauty of tech, unlike when I was a laborer on construction sites, is that there is often a ten-times better way to solve a problem in tech. What you actually need to build is usually less clear than people realize, and once you do understand it, there are often much simpler ways to get there. Overbuilding is the default in tech, usually because they never took the time to clarify the real need. The result is a generic monstrosity that only half solves the problem. Once you recognize that, you start to see opportunities to approach problems differently. But you cannot do that if you are stuck in stressed, execution-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;symptoms-of-hustle-culture&#34;&gt;Symptoms of hustle culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous thing about hustle culture isn’t just the long hours; it’s the systems it creates. Burnout becomes normal, vacations disappear, and leaders learn to paper over failure with stories of sacrifice. You see the same patterns everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vacations-that-never-happen&#34;&gt;Vacations that never happen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first joined AWS, I shadowed all the roles in the overall process I was going to automate; a process involving billions of dollars in infrastructure purchases. I was terrified when I discovered a single mid-level employee owned one of the steps in the critical path. They were the only person who had ever done the step. No one else knew how to do it. They scheduled their time off around performing that one step, and hadn’t taken a vacation longer than a week as a result since taking on the role. A single point-of-failure, dutifully keeping an empire running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a company culture demands always being on, it invites these types of systematic risks. Smaller versions exist on every team: the “indispensable” developer who never fully disconnects. Until they leave and you discover the trail of things they owned starting to fall apart. One of my first audits as a manager is simple: check when people last took real leave. Not a day off, but at least one week, preferably three. If it’s been over a year, that’s a red flag. It’s the easiest way to spot single points-of-failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-you-want-at-3-am&#34;&gt;Who you want at 3 a.m.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my teams required on-call duties. The engineers I trusted in those rotations weren’t the ones who glorified all-nighters. They were the ones who slept, took breaks, and stayed calm. At 3 a.m., clarity matters more than brute force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people I don’t want on call are the &lt;em&gt;heroes&lt;/em&gt; who think every problem can be solved by powering through. I’ve inherited teams with one developer who lived perpetually on call. That’s not dedication; it’s a disaster waiting to happen. It means no one else understands those systems, no one else can step in to help. And what happens if two of their systems break at the same time? Who are you going to bring in then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effort-as-a-cover-story&#34;&gt;Effort as a cover story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a meaningful amount of the promotion of hustle culture is actually just covering for failure. I’ve helped companies with the metrics-side of public statements for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When results are good, leaders talk about results. When results are bad, leaders talk about some obscure metric trending upward. When everything is bad, leaders talk about how hard everyone is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I assume when founders post something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby born two hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m back at the keyboard grinding on my lifelong dream: catpu.ai — Agentic AI for Cat Litterboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#founderlife #backtowork&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or when a CEO says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work long, hard, and smart; two out of three doesn’t cut it. Our competition is working seven days a week, 15 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the product were compelling, they’d talk about the product. If the company was doing what it needed to, they’d talk about that. If they had a strategy to lead the company forward and innovate, they’d preach it from the rooftops. But when they don’t, the message becomes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8miwsWtzRw&#34;&gt;“can you guys, um, work harder?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered different reasons otherwise smart people fall into this pattern of thinking. I’ve met the consultant-turned-executive who, after being trained on maximizing billable-hours, still thinks hours equal revenue. I’ve seen the non-technical leader who doesn’t understand what the team does, but just assumes the more, of whatever &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; is, the better. I’ve observed the too-far-away leader who is overwhelmed with the size of their org and is left with email blasts such as: &amp;ldquo;plz guys, can you just push until the goals are green?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-death-spiral&#34;&gt;The Death Spiral&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push these symptoms far enough and you hit the Death Spiral. It always starts the same way: a missed goal, a new threat, leadership with no clear plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we’re working at a social media company when TikTok first came out. At first, the company says: “not a big deal, totally different business than us”. Video view time starts decreasing. Maybe we broke something? Tell the engineers to look for any bugs. Meanwhile, once-golden demographics like US 15-22 year olds stopped showing up. What can be wrong? Then things get much worse. View time starts to nosedive. The engineers say nothing is broken, customers just aren’t showing up. Marketing reports are coming back saying our users are on TikTok. Competitive analysis points in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do? Now this is an emergency. You start the daily executive meeting to re-establish a sense of control. The CEO joins, your head of engineering, your head of product, some key engineers and product managers. Then the meeting grows and becomes more frantic. More action items are given. And they need to be done tomorrow. Tensions are high. No one wants to say the wrong thing. No one wants to push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people on the ground, it’s no longer: &lt;em&gt;‘How do I build a product people will love?’&lt;/em&gt; Instead it becomes: &lt;em&gt;‘Please Lord, get me through this meeting without getting fired.’&lt;/em&gt; Survival replaces results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team works more but accomplishes less. The best engineers leave, because they can. Progress collapses. Deadlines slip. Executives tighten their grip until—congratulations—they’ve killed the puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear. Anxiety. Stress. These are not the ingredients for success. If that’s your leadership’s plan in a crisis, run. Innovation beats exhaustion every time. And exhausted teams rarely innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-runways-doesnt-bring-planes&#34;&gt;Building runways doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring planes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long hours arise for different reasons. When young engineers work late because they’re genuinely obsessed with a problem, good managers teach discipline to sustain that enthusiasm. When teams work late because management demands it, you get theater: a simulacrum of enthusiasm without the corresponding breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak leaders see correlation (successful teams sometimes work long hours) and force the causation backwards, as if excellence spontaneously arises from butts-in-seat. They set goals on the easy thing, hours, because they can’t create the hard thing: genuine engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best managers spend more time pulling excited engineers away from keyboards than pushing tired ones toward them. They protect the flame of creativity from burning out rather than trying to extract it through force. The worst? They celebrate their suffering hoping people assume it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-my-ambitious-students&#34;&gt;To my ambitious students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re ambitious, don’t join the team making a virtue of late nights. Join the one building things they’re genuinely excited about and still going home for dinner. The best work happens when people have the energy and clarity to innovate, not when they’re competing to prove who can grind the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work hard and have fun. But more importantly, take care of yourself. When you sacrifice everything for your job, you risk becoming someone whose only identity is a title; the person who, years later, still introduces themselves not by who they are, but by what they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That loss of self is the same trap hustle culture sets for your career. The person who believes late nights are the only answer eventually stops learning new answers. As a manager, I never promoted someone already at the edge; they simply had no capacity left to grow. Advancement comes from finding better ways to get more done, not by spending more hours in the same old ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you truly want to aim high, remember this: The best teams aren&amp;rsquo;t defined by the hours they put in, but by the value they put out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are we cooked?</title>
      <link>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/are-we-cooked/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/are-we-cooked/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My students frequently ask me what LLMs mean for them as future software developers and data scientists. With little exaggeration it often comes across something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;low-key, are we cooked?&amp;rdquo;. The last one, if you are not one of my students, translates in millennial to &amp;ldquo;good esteemed professor, tell me true, are we f#@ked?&amp;rdquo; While I&amp;rsquo;ve given various off-the-cuff answers, I feel inspired to be more thoughtful in putting down more complete thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-personal-background&#34;&gt;Some personal background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start by giving a little personal history and just saying I understand the anxiety. I started my freshman year at CalPoly San Luis Obispo in Computer Science in September 1999. Like many of us older millennials that got into tech, I had been programming since elementary school (QBasic!) and computer science seemed a natural path. I always loved reading philosophy though and I seriously considered getting a philosophy degree instead. It was a choice between something I figured I was pretty decent at and could make money doing (computer science) and something that I was personally invested in but probably couldn&amp;rsquo;t make money with (philosophy). Earning a living won out over passion. I stuck with computer science, but I took as many philosophy classes as I could get into. To the extent that I was put on academic probation, not because my grades were too low, but because in the words of the admin &amp;ldquo;stop taking so many philosophy classes and just graduate!&amp;rdquo;. Good times…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a year of starting my degree, the tech market fell out. March 2000, we saw the dotcom bust, and here I was a computer science student, kind of doing it for the money, kind of not, and my sure bet didn&amp;rsquo;t seem so sure anymore. We also saw a revival of the perennial bugaboo for American software developers: outsourcing. Every decade brought fresh panic that all programming jobs &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.slashdot.org/story/04/10/15/1521231/us-programmers-an-endangered-species?sbsrc=thisday&#34;&gt;would&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://forio.com/about/blog/pitfalls-of-outsourcing-programmers/&#34;&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/business/business-who-wins-and-who-loses-as-jobs-move-overseas.html&#34;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, that American developers were too expensive, that we&amp;rsquo;d all be obsolete. I had to eat and had done a combination of construction and IT jobs up until that point and I was quickly burning through the savings I had built up from working. Luckily, I was able to convince one of my professors, Dr. Clint Staley, to whom I am forever grateful for many reasons, to let me interview for a startup he was running. Working that part-time while I went to school I was able to pay for myself, and momentum carried me forward to finishing my degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;are-we-cooked&#34;&gt;Are we cooked?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about teaching in a university is you get to ramble. It is the single most defining characteristic of professors. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure at this point my students are asking: can you get to the point, are we cooked or not? I consider myself a skeptical optimist at heart. Meaning, I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to believe that change is bad, but I&amp;rsquo;m also more cautious about predicting the future than others. Straightforwardly, that leads me to an answer of no, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you are cooked, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I can tell you with great certainty how things will play out. What I can do is point you towards the toolkit for how to make better decisions here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;embracing-uncertainty&#34;&gt;Embracing uncertainty&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is filled with uncertainty. Many people react irrationally to uncertainty, avoiding it too much or betting too much on luck. Learning how to deal rationally with uncertainty can give you an advantage throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2010 to 2016, I built and then led the supply chain and capacity planning systems for AWS Infrastructure. My biggest lesson is dollar for dollar, people are overly biased towards investing in prediction when they are often better suited to invest in flexibility. Time series forecasting tools take the past and extend it out to the future. The further out you go, the more variance you get. And black swan style events, like when &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-lessons-of-thailands-flood&#34;&gt;Thailand becomes flooded&lt;/a&gt; and you lose a healthy portion of the world&amp;rsquo;s hard-drive manufacturing capacity, are not frequent enough to learn from in a predictable way. Better to get a good enough forecast, but instead focus on shortening your lead-times, making your supply fungible—meaning interchangeable and adaptable to different uses—and late-binding your decisions as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallel to career planning is direct. You can spend a lot of time trying to accurately predict where LLMs will take the industry and the job market. But that will quickly hit diminishing returns. I would instead approach the question from the other angle: what skills are most likely to be durable and fungible—that is, transferable and valuable across different contexts—in a wide variety of potential outcomes? Going whole hog into &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to build my career around being a React developer&amp;rdquo; is betting on one very specific outcome. If it pays off, great, you can probably command a premium if you turn out to be one of the world&amp;rsquo;s best React developers. But what happens when React joins jQuery in the graveyard of once-essential frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;an-interlude-about-koalas&#34;&gt;An Interlude about Koalas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I graduated from college, I went to work for Lawrence Livermore National Labs as a computer scientist. I was working on translating large-scale semantic graph algorithms into usable interfaces for intelligence analysts. I had personally received an award from the Secretary of Homeland Security. We had the academic freedom to explore whatever angles we wanted. There was little pressure to meet deadlines. It felt like a safe and secure job for life working in my little niche. My former professor and boss, Dr. Staley, called me up and said his new startup was just acquired by some struggling online bookseller called Amazon. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super interested, as I could see existing in my current niche for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He convinced me to join by telling me a story about koalas. Koalas primarily subsist on eucalyptus leaves. Most other animals don&amp;rsquo;t eat eucalyptus, because they have little to no nutrition and they are kind of toxic. But koalas have built their entire evolutionary strategy around being the ones to eat eucalyptus leaves. This has been a great and successful strategy for koalas. But what happens if the eucalyptus forest goes away? Koalas are screwed. Does that mean koalas are actually in danger? No, but it does mean their fate is entirely bound to that one food source existing, while an animal like a rat can happily live and thrive in many ecosystems and is thus much more resistant to shocks in any given ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, that story convinced me to give Amazon a chance. Rather than focusing on a more niche area as defining &amp;ldquo;what I did&amp;rdquo; like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the person who designs usability for mathematically intensive applications,&amp;rdquo; I instead built my career around solving hard technical problems regardless of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-those-fungible-skills&#34;&gt;What are those fungible skills?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look back at the skills I learned in university, many of the specific technologies I learned never got used. I learned all about expert systems, but never built an expert system. I learned all about OpenGL, never used it. What I learned from my computer science courses that stuck was the more fundamental ideas of how to think about hard technical problems and create simple, workable solutions to them. For this reason, I often recommend to students who ask me which classes to take that it is more important to take a class that is difficult with a high degree of rigor that challenges you than to focus on any particular domain. Surprisingly, in retrospect, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten as much use out of the philosophy classes I took—that CalPoly tried to kick me out for taking too many of—as I did my computer science classes. Learning critical thinking skills, how to navigate difficult ethical situations, how to communicate difficult ideas. When Amazon asked me to design a system that could fairly allocate scarce resources across competing teams, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my coding skills that mattered most—it was my ability to think critically about the problem space and use data to understand and communicate trade-offs to executives who each thought their project was most important. What I&amp;rsquo;d say is my computer science skills were 95% of what initially got me in the door, but it was my liberal arts skills that dominated my later career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my answer is, whatever you do, take on challenging problems, regardless of the area, so you can learn the meta-cognitive skills to understand how you learn and face up to these challenges. Learn critical thinking and how to tear apart problems to turn them from intractable to tractable. And don&amp;rsquo;t neglect the human-side of building your ability to communicate and deal ethically and fairly with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, LLMs are different from outsourcing or the dot-com bust. They can actually write code—not just cheaper, but instantaneously. And yes, I’ve seen the headlines: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/14/programming-jobs-lost-artificial-intelligence/&#34;&gt;27% of programming jobs are gone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallstreetpit.com/127073-150k-software-engineer-turned-doordasher-after-800-ai-rejections/&#34;&gt;engineers facing hundreds of rejections&lt;/a&gt;. While I’m skeptical that this disruption is solely due to LLMs (e.g., a mix of post COVID overhiring, interest rate hikes, and broader economic shifts) there’s no doubt that a painful market correction is underway. But remember: every technological disruption feels unprecedented while it’s happening. The telephone operators watching automatic switches get installed thought their &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehistoryinsider.com/rise-fall-of-telephone-operators/&#34;&gt;world was ending&lt;/a&gt;. They were right about their specific job—wrong about their ability to adapt. The question isn’t whether LLMs will change things—they will. The question is whether you’ll be a koala or a rat when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, you&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily cooked. But you might be if you specialize too narrowly in whatever framework or language seems hot today. The jobs that are available will be different, and many of the existing software roles will not exist, at least in their current form. Build skills that transfer. Solve hard problems. Learn to think, not just code. The future needs people who can work with AI, not be replaced by it. And that future is built on the same foundation it always was: adaptability, critical thinking, and the uniquely human ability to navigate uncertainty with wisdom rather than fear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A time to dream</title>
      <link>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/a-time-to-dream/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/a-time-to-dream/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My success in life is based on my love and respect for daydreaming. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a daydreamer. At the age of seven, I envisioned a space opera of powerful Lizians, Heart Monkeys and Star People who fought against the tyrannical Lizard Men. I loved this world and I visited every chance I got. I spent so much time fleshing out my world rather than school work that by the end of high school I had a written a truly intricate science fiction novel and I had the poor grades to show it. It was also an amazingly horrible novel. When I showed it to a girl I liked in high school, because high school chicks dig sci-fi authors, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have anticipated the reaction, “I can&amp;rsquo;t believe you waste your time dreaming about stupid stuff like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, I still waste most of my time “dreaming about stupid stuff.” Most of those dreams now involve my work rather than fantastical worlds, but the love is still there. I set aside several hours every week to dream about what could be. I sprawl out in these dreams, I linger, and I set no goals for myself in what I hope to accomplish. I ask myself, what would make this amazing? Why would that be amazing? What is the essence of amazingness? I go down every corridor, until I get to the essence of the problem and the solution. This isn&amp;rsquo;t work that can measured; this is my time to enjoy myself and untangle life&amp;rsquo;s truly difficult puzzles. It is during these times that I get excited about the potential of what could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this time to dream, my work would have no direction. I would be subject to the whims of whomever is yelling the most at a particular moment or whatever crisis of the week has sprung up. Dreaming builds a vision and a vision creates purpose. When something urgent comes up, I can keep it in the context of whether it is truly more important than the great things I&amp;rsquo;ve envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where many other dreamers go wrong is their dreams stay dreams. I love my dreams, but I also respect them. That respect means that while I set aside time each week to dream, I spend the rest of my week making them happen. I temper my excitement for the amazingness of what could be by telling myself that greatness takes time. So I take the smallest step possible towards the dream that I can put into action. I then dream again the next week, but this time a smarter me is dreaming, informed by the realities of taking that small step forward. That smarter me comes up with an even better dream. Dream and reality march forward together as the work evolves, always daring to dream of perfection while letting reality take its time to get there. This constant cycle of vision and execution is what leads inevitably to success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Bad Programmer</title>
      <link>https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/the-bad-programmer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2008 21:25:04 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nick makes a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/in-defense-of-go-to/&#34;&gt;good argument&lt;/a&gt; for why go to should not be used. His closing argument is that zealous programmers will abuse go to. Pete makes a similar argument that go to has too much potential for abuse from programmers that we can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to explain the use of to and you are better off banning them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a similar argument people make when arguing for gun restrictions. As the politicians will tell you, &amp;ldquo;Sure we trust you with a gun, but do you trust your neighbor or the guys from across town with them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference though is that you have a lot of choice over who you work with. If you are limiting your choice of language or features based on the fact that you work with bad programmers I think you are trading off against the wrong factor. Do you want to work with bad programmers? Removing dangerous features from a language will certainly remove possibilities from bad programmers shooting themselves in the foot. They still won&amp;rsquo;t be good programmers though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many bad programmers will you even work with? Companies tend to have fairly regular hiring standards, at least at any departmental level and in my experience good programmers tend to work in the same place and bad programmers equally congregate. Indeed, in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1229231876&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;PeopleWare&lt;/a&gt; they demonstrated a strong correlation between programming ability and the layout of the office where they worked. If there is a strong correlation between office layout and ability then programmers in the same office will have a strong correlation in programming ability amongst themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boogeyman of bad programmers is a false threat to individual programmers. You are very likely only working with bad programmers if you are a bad programmer yourself. As a good programmer working with other good programmers, is go to still a bad idea?&lt;/p&gt;
