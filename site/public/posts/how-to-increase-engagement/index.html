  <article class="content numbered-subtitles">
    
    <p>In the early 90s, I first discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon">MUDs</a>: amazing text-based, multiplayer roleplaying-games before the web or silly things like graphics. I was one of those cool kids who played Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD&amp;D) and this was like that but you played with randos on the internet instead.</p>
<p>You started at level 1 killing rats for experience points. After you gained enough experience points, you leveled up, and your character became more powerful. Then you killed slimes, and goblins, and later trolls and dragons as your power grew. Unlike AD&amp;D, which required walking to a friend&rsquo;s house and coordinating schedules, MUDs were always there. Always waiting. Just one more level&hellip; I feigned illness to skip school and grind all day. My grades suffered. School was boring anyway though. Completing one more dungeon, getting better gear, just one more level; so much more satisfying than learning about arctangents.</p>
<h1 id="removing-luck-from-creating-engaging-experiences">Removing luck from creating engaging experiences</h1>
<p>MUDs were engaging because they tapped into core drives. Tech companies as a standard practice now have ways to refine those experiences and hack human desire in new and better ways. Want to build engaging experiences? By launching thousands and thousands of experiments (aka A/B tests) and optimizing for frequency of return and time spent, you don’t have to guess at what will make people more engaged. Instead, you place these many small bets, and statistically you will win in the long run by keeping the winners and discarding the rest.</p>
<h1 id="engaging-experiences-in-the-wild">Engaging experiences in the wild</h1>
<p>Meta honed this in through experimentation and optimizing for time spent. They were able to tap into people’s needs for social validation, for variable response which is a fun way to say gambling response (I sure hope this linkedin post gets more likes), and echo chambers. By using <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301003038">variable reward schedules</a> (e.g., &ldquo;I sure hope this post gets many likes and comments this time&rdquo;) you can trigger the same dopamine pathways as slot machines, which has been proven to make people come back for just one more hit. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27247125/">Social validation features</a> (likes and friends means people love me) are a perennial favorite for increasing retention as they exploit user&rsquo;s fundamental need for belonging. As another tip, make sure there are no natural stopping points in your application, by using <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10079169/">infinite scroll</a> you have a guaranteed winner for increasing raw session time. Luckily for all our brokerage accounts, many of the same product managers are circulating at your favorite tech companies spreading the same data-driven playbook.</p>
<p>We should of course learn from our elders in times past. Processed food and drink companies mastered finding the most cost-effective way to create snacks that make people crave more. Running thousands of experiments to find the exact combination of sugar, salt, and fat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_point_(food)">the bliss point</a>) to get people to buy more. One more soda, one more bag of chips. This is a huge win-win; the public gets cheap and tasty food and companies score huge profits.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies similarly were able to genetically engineer plants with twice the nicotine and add chemical compounds that made consumers more engaged with their product. Time spent smoking went up AND they were able to increase daily usage. Combining this with innovative marketing aimed at the youth market, they were able to create amazing lifetime-value from their customers.</p>
<h1 id="the-new-frontier-of-hyper-personalized-experiences">The new frontier of hyper-personalized experiences</h1>
<p>That is all in the past though, personally, I’m most excited about what we can do with LLMs. LLMs offer new and greater opportunities for companies to create engaging experiences with higher than ever time spent. I believe people overplay a lot of the existing weaknesses of LLMs. For instance, hallucinations aren’t as big a deal as people make them out to be, it is not necessary for an LLM to be truthful to create an engaging experience. We already learned that lesson from Facebook. Instead, as long as LLMs confirm <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642459">people’s existing biases</a> they will engage even more. Even better if the LLM tells users how <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">amazing their every thought is</a>, who doesn&rsquo;t want to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can tap into people’s needs for social validation in far more interesting ways than social media ever could with LLMs. We&rsquo;ve already seen that people will build <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2507.15783v1">deep emotional connections</a> with chatbots. Imagine the monetization opportunities. Think about the money people spend on OnlyFans, but now you don&rsquo;t even have to have content creators to do profit-sharing with. Chatbots can subtly suggest products. And don&rsquo;t forget the recurring revenue potential with subscriptions, nobody wants their best friend and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ad4wb/replika-ai-chatbot-romantic-partner-pandemic">lover</a> to be deleted.</p>
<p>If researchers and technologists start to become concerned about the societal impacts of these experiences, I suggest highlighting benchmarks and competitions as an excellent way to generate PR cover. Of course <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-clinches-milestone-gold-global-math-competition-while-openai-also-claims-2025-07-22/">AI winning math competitions</a> aren&rsquo;t going to pay the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers">massive data center bills</a>, we all know that is going to come down to active users * average-revenue-per-user. Most technologists were never good at understanding the business side though and are easily distracted so I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about them.</p>
<h1 id="dealing-with-the-irrational">Dealing with the irrational</h1>
<p>Following this playbook is a great way to make a lot of money. There will always be naysayers and fearmongers who will want to talk about long-term harm and destroying the fabric of society. The pointless philosophizers and academics; if they were as smart as they think they were then why aren&rsquo;t they rich? Remember, personal responsibility still exists; these are consumers making these decisions of their own free will. That is the basis of the free market system. Just because innovation has allowed us to discover new means of hacking into our core psychological and physilogical drives doesn&rsquo;t mean <strong>now</strong> is the time to stop progress. It&rsquo;s not fair if the music stops before you had a chance to get your bag. And that is the choice: you are either on the side of progress and innovation or you on the side of marxist-totalitatarian luddite do-nothings.</p>
<p>Worse yet is when your own concience starts to peep up. I&rsquo;ve found this happens sometimes when you accidently begin empathizing too much with your users. I’ve found it helps if you just keep focused on all of this as numbers: make time spent and active-users go up. Stare at those A/B tests and try not to think about the people behind them. Don’t worry about how or why the numbers are going up; the investors certainly won’t care. And as long as investors are happy your RSUs and options are enough to make you happy.</p>
<p>Oh sure, the naysayers and fearmongers might facetiously talk about concerns like &ldquo;is this the world you want to leave for your kids&rdquo;. Like you have time for kids when you are in the grindset. Even in the unlikely event you do decide to one day settle down and &ldquo;raise a family&rdquo;, at least be comforted that your children will be insulated from most of the damage. It isn&rsquo;t the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7484407/">rich kids getting fat</a>, it isn&rsquo;t the <a href="https://www.parents.com/is-screen-time-a-privilege-problem-11775414?utm_source=chatgpt.com">rich kids spending all their time on screens</a>, and by building these engaging experiences you and your children get to be on the right side of this equation.</p>
